I got the privilege to do the closing key note at the [ITMasters2015](http://itmasters2015.nl) in Amsterdam. I like to share the written version of this speech with everyone. I jumping right in and skipping all the &#8222;Good evening&#8220; talk üôÇ

I am traveling a lot these days and I have been at some Meetups recently to speak about MicroService and their cultural impact in the IT. Also as you might have recognized from my accent, I am German and with that I could probably consider myself a bit stiff when it comes to social etiquette. I prefer to shack hands, firm but not to hard, but please no hugging.

Let me briefly tell you a story: When I was preparing to held a talk in Ireland the host asked me how I would like to be introduced: ‚Äújust some short words, then I will join you on the stage we shack hands and I am taking over with introducing myself‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt consider this to be adequate and told me we should just keep it simple. All right then, let‚Äôs keep it simple.

So the host stepped on the stage, said some warm words about the event and finally introduced me. My queue to walk on stage! Suddenly I feel how my arm moving. The host, a bit surprised, also lifts his arm. So we were approaching each other, having both are arms ready for a firm but manly handshake, but shortly before we reach the point of no return I remember, this wasn‚Äôt what we agreed on and quickly let my arm slip down, as did the host, resulting in a very weird passing by.

So, what is this story about? I would consider myself smart enough to not be a shame for our species still I did this wrong. Because **_Change is hard!_**

But change is a constant in this profession and you need to find your filters early to not be overwhelmed by the massive amount of information that are being available for consumption. You probably can visualize yourself sitting at home frustrated about how many new read worthy links your Twitter Feed offers you ‚Äì and you just have been away for a short bathroom break. So buckle up, you are about to enjoy a great ride, this is just going more and more insane.

When I started as CTO for Lieferando in Germany, this title wasn‚Äôt actually earned. This was a honey pot to get me on board for 400‚Ç¨ a month and a mobile phone. In the end I was a 24 year old student, so this was a shitload of money and I got an IPhone 1 so I got this going for me. But I had to understand within one week that the code I was writing for University was worth nothing in business such as ours. Here speed matters so I coded the hell out of my keyboard and created a prototype within 1 month just to figure out 12 month later that I should have at least apply some things I have learned during my studies to save time in the long run, but here we are now. So ultimately I needed to do what is the fear of every project manager, **_the refactoring_** and with it all the symptoms: projects got delayed and investors got annoyed. I realized how much of my code actually represents the health of the company and that this is all it had in terms of assets. Code isn‚Äôt just a tool, it is the centre of the company and it needs constant change to improve, as does your company. There is no such thing as a perfect product, period!

**So first live lesson learned:** Change is the new normal

So I remember myself sitting in those chairs ‚Äì if I was lucky to get a chair, because Berlin University are badly crowded &#8211; So I was romanticizing about all the problems I am going to solve in my career. All those fancy languages I am going to make use of and all those technologies I can experiment with. Fairly this is the amazing part about the profession of ours &#8211; we usually have more solution than problems to solve while to be honest most of the problems we are creating ourselves.**¬†**

**Speaking of us‚Ä¶.**

How blind of me to realize very late: the main problem in IT, this is you and I ‚Äì and by this I mean people in general. The boundaries towards laying your hands on code have been struck down with the start of the Internet. It feels like training courses and tutorials making up the majority of the Internet &#8211; if you would ignore porn. We already have issues with over opinionated IT people such as Linus Torvalds who repetitively freaks out in the Unix kernel mailing lists, swearing and figuratively spitting towards the recipient with some rather rude words.

And I quote from one of his public comments in a pull request: ‚Äú_The above code is sh*t, and it generates shit code. It looks bad, and there‚Äôs no reason for it. So I really see no reason for this kind of complete idiotic crap.‚Äú._

Let‚Äôs not be this way, this kind of hatred becomes common in the IT business and is isolating groups. I haven‚Äôt yet heard someone publicly say: ‚ÄúYes I do like Java, but I also like PHP‚Äù. Honestly, most of the opinions are just reflected from something someone just read on a blog and adapted because in IT you apparently need to have a strong opinion about everything! The opinions can mostly be separated in two definitions

**Religion**: _developers defend the ideas they have without needing much evidence to back it up._

**Elitism**: _some people are being elitist and rejecting technology because of reasons that have nothing to do with technology._

We as the engineers of a young faculty need yet to learn a lot more than just engineering skills and need to recognize the responsibility that has been put into our hands with the talents we sharpen during university. We as coders shape the world ‚Äì or to be more hip: we disrupt business, but also social conventions and culture. Nothing will be spared, nothing is sacred ‚Äì resistants‚Äô is futile.

The applications that we write become part of our daily life and if we are lucky even of the life of others. Code is everywhere even where we do not recognize this ‚Äì fricking coffee machines are running Linux these days, this is the world we live in: a big network of things that communicate with each other. Buzzword alarm: Internet of Things!

We need to recognize our code as a language such as our spoken word and as such it has as much influence towards others as if we were speaking to them directly! As Chomsky figured some time ago: the only difference of our natural language compared to programming language is the presents or absences of context ‚Äì or to say for programming language there is only one interpretation while the spoken and the written word underlies tens of interpretations.

So first recap: we have natural language that has multiple interpretations and we have programming language providing us with multiple solutions to far less problems ‚Ä¶ great. Seems to be an easy assignment to find an agreement of what the best solution is that a team should go for, right? Right!

I experienced this by heart when I became the CTO from takeaway.com 8 month ago. To give you some context: Lieferando, a German based food delivery start-up, the company I have been the CTO for 5 years before, has been acquired by takeaway.com in early 2014. Therefore the business wasn‚Äôt new for me, but this didn‚Äôt matter. Two application stacks, two teams but more importantly two cultures have been forced together. Sadly not the only contradiction I had to face. While in Berlin I was not questioned anymore the team Enschede was and is very doubtful about every step that I am doing. Both not ideal situations, because without being questioned you cannot reflect on the work you are providing and are exposed to suffer from imposter syndrome ‚Äì you miss the constant change because of missing criticism. But with constant doubt it is also hard to move together with a team.

So I needed to learn in a foreign language in a foreign country to explain my ideas of a high quality product in such a manner that the developers could translate this to code without me watching over them all the time. I never ever improved more in such a short time.

**So second life lesson:** Code is your language; with code you express your abstraction of the reality and document your thoughts. But your thoughts must be put into words first.

Furthermore code creates networks, architecture emerges, and infrastructure is being setup. _Organizations which design systems &#8230; are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations_ ‚Äì not my words, but those of Melvin Conway. A man, who recognized something so simple yet so intriguing. The structure of the team we are working in and the way this team is exchanging information constraints the outcome of the system we aim to build. Once again it hit me that my social reality is reflected in the system my code produces. If you think about that ‚Äòteam‚Äô by definition can also be an open source community. Obviously they are building more decoupled modularized components, because this is the way they need to communicate with all those remote, probably even unknown persons while product focused teams are rather building monolithic applications since they have all their communication happen in one room.

**So third live lesson learned:** Architectural decisions are mostly not related to educational level of the teams but to the communication patterns happening within the team. Those are that define the business and the architecture.

To sum this up! Code influence society, but code is also shaped by society. This is a bilateral exchange. You can never force a team to change their architecture if you don‚Äôt take the persons into account involved in this project and if you cannot explain your ideas to them. They will have to change their communication structure to make this work as well. So swarm out and work with different teams, don‚Äôt stick to the same peers for coding all the time, you will stop learning at some point in time. Get insights from other companies in other countries to fully understand the way your code changes if you are experiencing different languages and cultures. Incorporate the business you are working in into your application and you will be a great success. Or at best contribute to open source projects, there you get the full charge!

In this sense I like to quote Linus Torvalds once more

_In open source, we feel strongly that to really do something well, you have to get a lot of people involved._

Finally some nice words J
